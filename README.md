# First-bot-Chatbot
Making a very simple chatbot with JS

Refactored the code a couple of times; first I moved the responses from within each if block into it's own array for better readability and expandability.

Then I moved a couple of lines of code that was repeated in each if/else block and placed inside a single function 'addOne()'.

The only thing that remains is turining the entire if/else blosk into a for loop of some kind.
